description         CLI for installing and managing Ambassador

long_description    Edge Control is the command-line tool for installing and \
                    managing the Ambassador Edge Stack. And Edge Control's \
                    outbound and intercept features allow developers to \
                    preview changes to their services while sharing a single \
                    development cluster. If you are a developer working on a \
                    service that depends on other in-cluster services, use \
                    \`edgectl connect\` to set up connectivity from your \
                    laptop to the cluster. This allows software on your \
                    laptop, such as your work-in-progress service running in \
                    your debugger, to connect to other services in the \
                    cluster.  When you want to test your service with traffic \
                    from the cluster, use \`edgectl intercept\` to designate \
                    a subset of requests for this service to be redirected to \
                    your laptop. You can use those requests to test and debug \
                    your local copy of the service. All other requests will \
                    go to the existing service running in the cluster \
                    without disruption.
