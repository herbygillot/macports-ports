description         Heavily optimized library for DEFLATE/zlib/gzip \
                    compression and decompression

long_description    libdeflate is a library for fast, whole-buffer \
                    DEFLATE-based compression and decompression. It has \
                    support for the DEFLATE (raw), zlib (DEFLATE w/ zlib \
                    wrapper), and gzip (DEFLATE w/ gzip wrapper) formats. \
                    It is heavily optimized, and significantly faster than \
                    the zlib library, both for compression and decompression, \
                    and especially on x86 processors. In addition, libdeflate \
                    provides optional high compression modes that provide a \
                    better compression ratio than the zlib's \"level 9\".
