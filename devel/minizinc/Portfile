description         MiniZinc is a free and open-source constraint modeling \
                    language.

long_description    {*}${description} You can use MiniZinc to model \
                    constraint satisfaction and optimization problems \
                    in a high-level, solver-independent way, taking advantage \
                    of a large library of pre-defined constraints. Your model \
                    is then compiled into FlatZinc, a solver input language \
                    that is understood by a wide range of solvers. MiniZinc \
                    is developed at Monash University in collaboration with \
                    Data61 Decision Sciences and the University of Melbourne.
