description         A data templating language for app and tool developers \
                    which is a simple extension of JSON.

long_description    {*}${description} The name Jsonnet is a portmanteau of \
                    JSON and sonnet, pronounced \"jay sonnet\". It began life \
                    early 2014 as a 20% project and was launched on Aug 6. \
                    The design is influenced by several configuration \
                    languages internal to Google, and embodies years of \
                    experience configuring some of the world's most complex \
                    IT systems.
