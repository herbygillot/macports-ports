description         \
    UniversalCodeGrep \(ucg\) is an extremely fast grep-like tool specialized \
    for searching large bodies of source code.

long_description    \
    {*}${description} It is intended to be largely command-line compatible \
    with Ack, to some extent with ag, and where appropriate with grep. Search \
    patterns are specified as PCRE regexes. ucg is intended to address the \
    impatient programmer\'s code searching needs. ucg is written in C++20 and \
    takes advantage of the concurrency \(and other\) support of the language \
    to increase scanning speed while reducing reliance on third-party \
    libraries and increasing portability. Regex scanning is provided by the \
    PCRE2 library, with its JIT compilation feature providing a huge \
    performance gain on most platforms. Directory tree traversal is performed \
    by multiple threads, reducing the impact of waiting for I\/O completions. \
    Critical functions are implemented with hand-rolled vectorized \
    \(SSE2\/4.2\/etc.\) versions selected at program load-time based on what \
    the system supports, with non-vectorized fallbacks.
